## Data Directory
Currently makes use of a .env file to specify where to scan for movies (currently set to `./Movies`. By default it will look in `/Movies` for media, unless specified by the `dataDir` environment variable. This location can be easily changed by editing the `.env` file and point it wherever needed to be.
